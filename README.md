# LuaProgramming

**Practice Lua for designing and combining with C++23**

This project explores the use of **Lua scripting** in combination with modern **C++23** features. It’s intended as a playground for learning, prototyping, and integrating Lua into larger C++ applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Embed Lua scripts into C++23 applications  
- Practice writing clean and modular Lua code  
- Experiment with Lua-C++ interop patterns  
- Test ideas for game scripting, configuration, or plugin systems

## 🧩 Requirements

- C++23 compliant compiler (e.g., GCC 13+, MSVC, Clang)
- Lua (version 5.4 recommended)
- CMake (if using a build system)
